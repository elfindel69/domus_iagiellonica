Welcome to Domus Iagiellonica, a world where the Jagiellonian dynasty survived and flourished until the Victorian era. 

In this new world, the Napoleonic Wars never happened, changing the map of Europe as we know it.

King Sigismund II gave Poland an heir in 1549; the kingdom remained a hereditary monarchy.
The kingdom unified Poland and Lithuania under the name of the Kingdom of Poland-Lithuania.

The kingdom, under a stable dynasty, reformed and acquired new territories, notably against the Cossacks in 1648.
The Poles then allied themselves with the Austrians against the Ottomans and began the reconquest of the Balkans (1698 - 1750).

During the 19th century, the kingdom modernized and reformed. A constitution was signed in 1792. 

On the French side, Napoleon got bogged down in Italy, but the Republic still signed the treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the country annexed the Netherlands and the Rhineland.
The Directory was overthrown in 1800 and King Louis XVIII was crowned in 1802. He tried to return to the Old Regime, without success. 
The king was deposed in 1820. Louis Philippe was crowned King of the French the following year.
